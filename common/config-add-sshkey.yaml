# 🧩 Playbook: config-add-sshkey.yaml
# 📘 Description:
#   Creates (if necessary) a user on target hosts, installs an SSH public key
#   into that user’s `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, and grants passwordless sudo access
#   specifically for that user via a separate configuration file under `/etc/sudoers.d/`.
#   This ensures secure, key-based access and controlled administrative privileges
#   for automation or maintenance.
#
# 🔧 Notes:
#   - Targets hosts defined by `target_group` (defaults to none).
#   - Automatically creates the user and home directory if it does not exist.
#   - Reads the SSH public key from the local control node file `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`
#     (or another file if specified).
#   - Grants passwordless sudo only for the created or specified user, not for all `sudo` members.
#   - Requires root privileges (`become: true`).
#
# 🧠 Example usage:
#   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini ./common/config-add-sshkey.yaml \
#     -e "target_group=UbuntuServers ssh_user=ahmed ssh_key_path=~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"
#
# 🧱 Variables:
#   - ssh_user: The username to configure (default: ansible)
#   - ssh_key_path: Path to the public key on the control node (default: ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
#   - target_group: Inventory group or hosts to apply changes to


- name: Configure SSH key and passwordless sudo for a specific user
  hosts: "{{ target_group | d([]) }}"
  become: true     # <— enables sudo for privileged actions

  vars:
    ssh_user: "{{ ssh_user | default('ubuntu') }}"
    ssh_key_path: "{{ ssh_key_path | default('~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"
